# Python - Async Function

This project contains implementations of asynchronous functions and coroutines in Python.

## Files

- `0-basic_async_syntax.py` - Basic async coroutine that waits for a random delay
- `1-concurrent_coroutines.py` - Execute multiple coroutines concurrently 
- `2-measure_runtime.py` - Measure execution time of async functions
- `3-tasks.py` - Create asyncio.Task objects
- `4-tasks.py` - Execute multiple tasks concurrently

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Python 3.9
- pycodestyle 2.5.x
- All files must be executable
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated
- All modules and functions must have documentation
